Introduction
============

Here is some random text. Blah, blah. And some more random text! Just can't get enough!


About the software
==================

The Transport Experiment program was written (and is still being updated) for
running transport measurements in the research group of Professor Nitin
Samarth at the Pennsylvania State University.

The project was begun, and most of the code was written, by Thomas
C. Flanagan in 2013.

I would like to thank the following people for enabling this project:

* David Hopper, for valuable contributions to the code;
* Anthony Richardella, for various suggests for the interface, some of which were sensible; and
* Abhinav Kandala, for giving me time to write it.
