"""Modules for graphically interacting with the software

The `gui` package provides modules which provide the program with graphical
functionality.

Notes
-----
The current implementation of the graphical interface in the software is
wxPython, which is a collection of Python wrappers, managed by Robin Dunn, for 
the C-based wxWidgets library. This system was chosen because it is

1. simple and intuitive (at least for a graphical engine),
2. fast (because the base is written in C),
3. popular (it is included in most python distributions), and
4. cross-platform.
