"""Frames and panels for graphing.

Currently, this package provides two modules for graphing:

basicpanel
    A simple, single-graph (but multi-plot) panel for displaying data.
basicframe
    A frame for containing graph panels. This version allows for a single
    graph panel. The module also includes a thread for keeping the graph
    up to date and a `GraphManager` class to keep track of multiple graphs.
