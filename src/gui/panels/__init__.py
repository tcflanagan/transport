'''A collection of panels which may reasonably have uses in multiple frames

Many user interfaces may be expected to share components. This package provides
a collection of panels---sophisticated components which can be built into
frames---which are likely to find such various uses. Some notable examples are 
the contents of the following modules:

scanpanel:
    A panel for managing the starting points, ending points, and step sizes
    for scan operations.
graphpanel:
    A panel used for graphing data. This is used by the one-graph-per-frame
    system which is the default when using the Experiment Editor, but it might
    be used in an all-graphs-in-one-frame scheme that could be designed in the
    future or in a custom user interface designed for a commonly performed
    experiment.
